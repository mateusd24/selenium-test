read and considered and is denied. Petitioner is barred from raising issues
rejected on appeal. (In re Waltreus (1965) 62 Cal.2d 218, 225.) He attempts to

conclusory and unsupported by evidence of the actual composition of the
lineup, and it fails to establish a prima facie case for habeas relief. (Pen.
Code, § 1473, subd. (e); People v. Duvall (1995) 9 Cal.4th 464, 474-475.)",,,,none
